# Bike-Buyer
A classification model that predicts a customer's likelihood to buy a bike.
In this notebook i will be creating a model to predict a customers purchase behaviour. I will be using the customer data to create a classification model that predicts a customer's likelihood to buy a bike. The data includes demographic features and purchase history of the customers. The Bike company is interested in discovering any apparent relationships between demographic features known about customers and whether they purchase a bike.
The notebook will be presented as follow:
Data Preprocessing & Cleansing
Exploratory data analysis & Visualisation
Feature Engineering
Data Modeling
Evaluting the Model
Conclusion

# Goal
The goal is to predict the customers' purchase behaviour. For each customer, I will predict a 0 or 1 for the BikeBuyer variable. (1 means the customer will buy a bike, 0 means a customer will not)
